  					<p>/From the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956, Hemingway was bedridden.[131] He was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage, advice he initially followed but then disregarded.[132] In October 1956, he returned to Europe and met Basque writer Pio Baroja, who was seriously ill and died weeks later. During the trip, Hemingway became sick again and was treated for "high blood pressure, liver disease, and arteriosclerosis".[131]
